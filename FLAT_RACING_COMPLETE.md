## 🎯 Expected Betting Performance

### **Win Bets** (Rank ≤ 2 filter):
```
Expected Win Rate: 20-30%
Target ROI: Positive after 30+ bets
Strategy: Very selective, top 2 picks only
Risk: Low (small stakes, high confidence)
```

### **Place Bets** (Rank ≤ 4 filter):
```
Expected Win Rate: 55-65%
Target ROI: Positive immediately
Strategy: Broader, top 4 picks in 3-place races
Risk: Lower (higher success probability)
```

### **Current Results** (from initial mixed testing):
```
Before (Mixed Types):
  - 44 bets placed
  - 18% win rate overall
  - ROI: -30.5%
  
After Initial Flat Testing:
  - 10 bets placed (much more selective)
  - Place bets: 57% win rate, -5.7% ROI
  - Win bets: 0/3 (small sample)
  - Overall: -28.91% ROI
  
Expected After Full Flat System:
  - Even more selective (rank filters)
  - Focus on model's top picks
  - Target: Positive ROI on 50+ bets
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### **Phase 3: Additional Race Types** (Optional)

Once Flat racing is profitable:

```bash
# Train Hurdle model
cd Datafetch/ml
python train_baseline.py --race-type Hurdle

# Train Chase model  
python train_baseline.py --race-type Chase
```

Then enable the disabled options in GUI comboboxes.

### **Phase 4: Enhanced Features** (Optional)

For Flat racing:
- Sectional times (if data available)
- Enhanced track bias indicators
- Position in running data
- Equipment changes tracking

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **"Model not found" error:**
```bash
# Train the Flat model:
cd Datafetch/ml
python train_baseline.py --race-type Flat
```

### **Seeing non-Flat races in recommendations:**
```bash
# Restart GUI to load new code:
# 1. Close GUI completely
# 2. Kill Python process in terminal (Ctrl+C)
# 3. Restart: python Datafetch/racecard_gui.py
```

### **Poor predictions:**
```bash
# Check training metrics:
cat Datafetch/ml/models/feature_importance_flat.csv | head -20

# Verify Flat-specific features are high:
# - draw should be in top 10
# - draw_position_normalized should be visible
```

### **Want to retrain:**
```bash
cd Datafetch/ml
python train_baseline.py --race-type Flat --test-size 0.2

# Or use GUI: ML Training tab → Select Flat → Start Training
```
