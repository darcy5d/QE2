Training progress → signals → GUI log updates
    ↓
Training complete → results dict → GUI display
    ↓
Model saved to ml/models/
```

## 🎯 Technical Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Statistics only load when tab is first opened
2. **Background Threading**: Model training doesn't block UI (QThread)
3. **Pagination**: Sample data limited to 50 rows at a time
4. **Caching**: Statistics cached after first load until refresh
5. **Efficient Queries**: Database helper uses indexed queries

### User Experience
1. **Real-time Feedback**: Training log updates live during training
2. **Progress Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for all operations
3. **Error Handling**: Friendly error messages with context
4. **Tooltips**: (Future) Could add tooltips for better guidance
5. **Responsive**: GUI remains responsive during long operations

### Code Quality
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Database logic separate from UI
2. **Reusable Components**: MLDatabaseHelper used by both tabs
3. **Type Hints**: Included where helpful for clarity
4. **Docstrings**: All major methods documented
5. **Consistent Styling**: Dark theme applied throughout
