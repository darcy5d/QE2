# Column Count Fix - RESOLVED ‚úì

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Issue:** `96 values for 95 columns` error during feature generation  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

## Problem

When running feature generation, the system encountered SQL errors:
```
Error saving features (schema may need update): 96 values for 95 columns
```

## Root Cause

The `save_features()` method in `feature_engineer.py` had a mismatch:
- **Database columns:** 95 (correct)
- **INSERT statement columns:** 95 (correct)  
- **VALUES placeholders (?):** 96 (‚ùå ONE TOO MANY)
- **VALUES tuple entries:** 95 (correct)

The issue was an extra `?` placeholder in the VALUES clause of the SQL INSERT statement.

## Investigation Process

1. **Initial confusion**: Thought `jockey_distance_win_rate` was missing from schema
2. **Removed it**: Made things worse (94 columns vs 95)
3. **Added it back**: Still had error (96 vs 95)
4. **Root cause found**: Counted `?` placeholders manually
   - Line 1252: 21 ?
   - Line 1253: 21 ?
   - Line 1254: 21 ?
   - Line 1255: 18 ?
   - Line 1256: 15 ?
   - **Total: 96** (should be 95)

## Solution

Removed one `?` placeholder from line 1256:
```python
# Before (96 placeholders)
?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?

# After (95 placeholders)
?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?
```

## Verification

Tested with 10 races:
```bash
python -m ml.feature_engineer --test
```

Result:
```
‚úì FEATURE GENERATION COMPLETE
  Races processed: 10
  Runners processed: 109
```

**No errors!** ‚úÖ

## Files Modified

- `Datafetch/ml/feature_engineer.py` - Fixed VALUES placeholder count in `save_features()` method

## Status

‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Feature generation now works correctly with all 95 columns including the 14 new features from the odds implementation.

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for:
1. ‚úÖ Full feature regeneration on historical data
2. ‚úÖ Model retraining with 92 total features (77 old + 15 new)
3. ‚úÖ Performance validation against baseline

The odds and new fields implementation is complete and operational! üéØ
