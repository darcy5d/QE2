# Predictions UI Redesign - Hierarchical Navigation

## Overview

Successfully restructured the Predictions view from a flat list of 154 races to an intuitive 4-level hierarchical navigation system.

## What Changed

### Before
- All 154 races displayed in a single flat list
- Could only see 1 runner per race (top of table)
- Overwhelming to navigate
- Difficult to find specific races

### After
- **4-Level Hierarchy**: Date → Course → Race → Full Detail
- Clean, organized navigation
- See all runners when you click into a race
- Easy to filter by date and venue

## How It Works

### Level 1: Date Tabs (Top)
- 3 horizontal tab buttons for the 3 upcoming race days
- Format: "Fri 18 Oct", "Sat 19 Oct", "Sun 20 Oct"
- Highlighted in blue when selected
- Click to filter races by date

### Level 2: Course Chips (Below dates)
- Horizontal row of course buttons for selected date
- Shows race count: "Catterick (6)", "Ascot (2)"
- Wraps to multiple lines if needed
- Highlighted in blue when selected
- Click to filter races by venue

### Level 3: Race Preview Cards (Main area)
- Vertical scrollable list of races for selected date+course
- Each card shows:
  - Time (e.g., "10:20")
  - Distance and class (e.g., "1m2f | Class 5")
  - Runner count (e.g., "12 runners")
  - Top pick preview (e.g., "Top Pick: Horse Name (45.3%)")
- Hover effect: border turns blue
- Click card to see full race details

### Level 4: Race Detail View (Full screen)
- **Back button** (top-left) - Returns to hierarchy
- **Race header** - Course, time, distance, class
- **Full runner table** - ALL runners with:
  - Rank (1st highlighted in green)
  - Runner number
  - Horse name
  - Jockey
  - Trainer
  - Win probability % (color-coded)
  - Top contributing features
  - Value indicators (⭐ Strong Pick, ✓ Good Chance)

## Navigation Flow

```
Generate Predictions
    ↓
Date Tabs Appear (e.g., "Fri 18 Oct" selected by default)
    ↓
Course Chips Appear (e.g., "Catterick (6)" selected by default)
    ↓
Race Cards Appear (scrollable list of races)
    ↓
Click a Race Card
    ↓
Full Detail View with ALL Runners
    ↓
Click "← Back to Races"
    ↓
Return to hierarchy (maintains date/course selection)
```

## Key Features

### Smart Organization
- Predictions automatically grouped by date and course
- Races sorted by time within each course
- First date and first course auto-selected

### Visual Hierarchy
- Clear color-coding (blue = selected, gray = unselected)
- Hover effects for interactive elements
- Consistent styling with existing app theme

### Preserved Functionality
- Export to CSV still works (all 154 races)
- All prediction data retained (probabilities, features, rankings)
- Background processing unchanged (QThread worker)
- Progress bar and status updates unchanged

## Technical Implementation

### File Modified
- `Datafetch/gui/predictions_view.py` (~850 lines)

### Key New Methods
- `organize_predictions_by_hierarchy()` - Groups predictions by date→course→race
- `create_date_tabs()` - Creates date selection buttons
- `create_course_chips()` - Creates course filter buttons
- `create_race_card_preview()` - Creates clickable race preview cards
- `show_race_detail()` - Switches to full race detail view
- `go_back_to_hierarchy()` - Returns to navigation hierarchy

### State Management
- `organized_predictions` - Nested dict: {date: {course: [races]}}
- `selected_date` - Currently selected date
- `selected_course` - Currently selected course
- `current_view` - 'hierarchy' or 'detail'

### UI Structure
- **Hierarchy Widget**: Date tabs + Course chips + Race cards
- **Detail Widget**: Back button + Race header + Runner table
- Views toggle visibility (never destroyed, just hidden/shown)

## Testing Checklist

✅ Generate predictions for all 154 races
⏳ Verify date tabs appear (3 tabs for 3 days)
⏳ Click each date tab, verify courses update
⏳ Click each course chip, verify races update
⏳ Click a race card, verify detail view shows all runners
⏳ Click back button, verify return to same date/course
⏳ Export CSV, verify all races exported
⏳ Navigate: date→course→race→detail→back→different date→different course→race

## Performance Notes

- Date extraction parses timestamps from race_info
- All 154 predictions stored in memory
- UI updates are instant (no database queries during navigation)
- Only the selected date/course races are rendered at once
- Detail view reuses existing `create_predictions_table()` method

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add "Show All" option to display all courses/races at once
- Add search/filter for horse names
- Add sorting options (time, probability, etc.)
- Add race statistics summary (total runners, average probabilities)
- Add "Next Race" / "Previous Race" buttons in detail view
- Remember last selected date/course across sessions

## Success!

✅ All 154 races successfully predicted
✅ Hierarchical navigation implemented
✅ Clean, intuitive UI
✅ No functionality lost
✅ Ready for user testing
