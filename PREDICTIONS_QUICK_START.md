# üèá Predictions Quick Start Guide

## Current System Status

‚úÖ **Database**: 87% odds coverage (396,120 / 455,242 runners)  
‚úÖ **Features**: All regenerated with odds data  
‚úÖ **Model**: Trained with 34.2% top pick accuracy  
‚úÖ **GUI**: All processes integrated and ready  

## What's Already in the GUI

Your GUI has everything you need:

### Tab 1: Dashboard
- Overview of database stats
- Feature coverage metrics
- Model performance summary

### Tab 2: Data Fetch
- **Option 1**: Update to specific date
- **Option 2**: Update to yesterday
- **Option 3**: Complete database rebuild (created earlier)
- **Fetch Racecards**: Get upcoming races

### Tab 3: ML Features  
- **Regenerate Features**: Uses optimized parallel processing (9 workers)
- Feature statistics and coverage
- Already using `feature_engineer_optimized.py` ‚úÖ

### Tab 4: ML Training
- **Train Model**: Uses `train_baseline.py` with odds features
- Real-time training progress
- Feature importance display
- Model evaluation metrics

### Tab 5: Predictions  
- **Fetch Upcoming Races**: Get today's/tomorrow's racecards
- **Generate Predictions**: Run the trained model
- Win probabilities for each horse
- Exotic bet probabilities (Exacta, Trifecta, Superfecta)

## How to Test Predictions NOW

### Step 1: Launch the GUI

```bash
cd /Users/darcy5d/Desktop/DD_AI_models/QE2/Datafetch
python racecard_gui.py
```

### Step 2: Fetch Upcoming Races

1. Click on **Tab 5: "Predictions"**
2. Click **"Fetch Upcoming Races"** button
3. Wait ~5-10 seconds for API response
4. You'll see a list of upcoming races organized by:
   - Date
   - Course
   - Race time

### Step 3: Generate Predictions

1. **Click on any race** in the list
2. Click **"Generate Predictions"** button
3. Wait 2-3 seconds for predictions to compute
4. View results:
   - **Win Probability**: Model's confidence for each horse
   - **Ranking**: Horses sorted by predicted finish
   - **Exotic Bets**: Exacta, Trifecta, Superfecta probabilities

### Step 4: Verify Odds Features

Look for these in the predictions:
- **Odds-based predictions**: Should see varied probabilities (not flat!)
- **Clear favorites**: Top picks should have 20-40% win probability
- **Longshots**: Bottom horses should have 1-5% win probability

## What You Should See

### Before Odds Enrichment (Old)
```
Horse A: 7%
Horse B: 7%
Horse C: 7%
Horse D: 6%
Horse E: 6%
```
‚ùå All predictions flat and useless

### After Odds Enrichment (Now!)
```
Horse A: 34%  ‚Üê Clear favorite
Horse B: 22%  ‚Üê Strong contender
Horse C: 15%  ‚Üê Outside chance
Horse D:  8%  ‚Üê Longshot
Horse E:  3%  ‚Üê Outsider
```
‚úÖ Differentiated and actionable predictions!

## Example Workflow

### Test a Real Race

```bash
# 1. Launch GUI
cd /Users/darcy5d/Desktop/DD_AI_models/QE2/Datafetch
python racecard_gui.py

# GUI opens...

# 2. Go to Predictions tab (Tab 5)
# 3. Click "Fetch Upcoming Races"
# 4. Wait for races to load
# 5. Click on any race (e.g., "14:30 - Newmarket")
# 6. Click "Generate Predictions"
# 7. View results!
```

### What to Look For

‚úÖ **Win Probabilities**: Should range from 3-40%  
‚úÖ **Top Pick**: Should match or be close to betting favorite  
‚úÖ **Clear Gradient**: Favorites ‚Üí Longshots  
‚úÖ **Odds Features**: Model using odds data (shown in logs)

## Behind the Scenes

When you click "Generate Predictions", the system:

1. **Loads the trained model** (`xgboost_baseline.json`)
2. **Fetches runner data** from `upcoming_races.db`
3. **Computes 91 features** per runner, including:
   - ‚úÖ `odds_decimal` (feature importance: 69.32!)
   - ‚úÖ `odds_implied_prob` (feature importance: 33.19!)
   - ‚úÖ `odds_rank`, `odds_market_stability`, etc.
   - Plus all traditional features (RPR, TS, form, etc.)
4. **Runs XGBoost ranking model**
5. **Normalizes probabilities** to sum to 100%
6. **Displays results** with pretty formatting

## If You Want to Retrain Later

The GUI makes it easy:

### Retrain with New Data

1. **Tab 2: Data Fetch**
   - Click "Update to Yesterday" to get latest data
   
2. **Tab 3: ML Features**
   - Click "Regenerate Features" (uses 9 workers, ~25 min)
   
3. **Tab 4: ML Training**
   - Click "Train Model" (takes ~40 seconds)
   
4. **Tab 5: Predictions**
   - Test with new model!

## Performance Expectations

Based on our training results:

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Top Pick Win Rate** | 34.2% | Our #1 pick wins 1 in 3 races |
| **Top 3 Hit Rate** | 68.3% | Our top 3 picks include winner 2/3 of time |
| **NDCG@3** | 0.5399 | Strong ranking quality |

### Reality Check

- **Baseline** (random guess): ~10-11% top pick accuracy
- **Our model**: **34.2%** accuracy
- **Improvement**: **3.1x better than random!**

## Troubleshooting

### "No upcoming races found"

- Solution: Check if races are scheduled for today/tomorrow
- Alternative: Use Data Fetch tab to pull specific date

### "Model not found"

- Solution: Go to ML Training tab and click "Train Model"
- Takes 40 seconds to complete

### "Flat predictions still"

- Check: Is model trained? (see `ml/models/xgboost_baseline.json` date)
- Check: Are features regenerated? (Tab 3 should show high coverage)
- Check: Is odds coverage good? (Dashboard should show ~87%)

### "Features not found"

- Solution: Go to ML Features tab and click "Regenerate Features"
- Takes ~25 minutes for full dataset
- Uses parallel processing (9 workers)

## Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Track Real Performance

- Test predictions on upcoming races
- Record actual results
- Compare against model predictions
- Validate the 34.2% accuracy claim!

### 2. Add Historical Odds Enrichment to GUI

Currently, odds enrichment is via command line:
```bash
python enrich_odds_from_results.py
```

Could add button to Data Fetch tab for easy re-enrichment.

### 3. Explore Feature Importance

- Go to ML Training tab
- After training, view feature importance table
- See that odds features dominate!

### 4. Experiment with Model Parameters

- In ML Training tab
- Adjust test/train split
- Try different hyperparameters
- See if you can beat 34.2% accuracy!

## Summary

‚úÖ **All processes are in the GUI**:
