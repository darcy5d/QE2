## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Database Schema (8 New Tables)

```sql
results                -- Race outcomes (positions, times, odds)
├── horse_career_stats -- Pre-computed horse statistics
├── trainer_stats      -- Trainer performance by period
├── jockey_stats       -- Jockey performance by period
├── trainer_jockey_combos -- Partnership statistics
├── form_history       -- Parsed form features
├── ml_features        -- Feature vectors (~50 columns)
└── ml_targets         -- Target labels (won, placed, etc.)
```

### Feature Categories (50+ Features)

1. **Horse Features** (20) - Age, career stats, form, course/distance/going performance
2. **Trainer Features** (7) - Win rates, ROI, specializations
3. **Jockey Features** (7) - Recent form, course expertise
4. **Combo Features** (3) - Trainer-jockey partnership stats
5. **Race Context** (7) - Distance, going, class, prize money
6. **Runner Specifics** (8) - Draw, weight, ratings
7. **Relative Features** (4) - Vs field averages

- **Racecards**: 22,604 races, 239,552 runners (Jan 2023 - Jun 2024)
- **Results**: ~28,000 results fetched (79% complete, finishing in ~10 min)
- **Coverage**: Jan 23 - Apr 30, 2023 (98 days)

### Statistics Ready to Compute
- ~10,550 unique horses
- ~1,500+ trainers
- ~1,200+ jockeys
- ~5,000+ trainer-jockey combos

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Automated)

### Option 1: Fully Automated (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/darcy5d/Desktop/DD_AI_models/QE2/Datafetch
./ml/run_full_pipeline.sh
```

**This will:**
1. Wait for results fetch to complete (if still running)
2. Compute all statistics (~10-15 minutes)
3. Generate ML features (~5-10 minutes)
4. Validate data quality
5. Display final status

**Total time:** ~20-30 minutes

### Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step

```bash
# 1. Wait for fetch (check with tail -f fetch_results.log)
# 2. Compute statistics
python ml/compute_stats.py

# 3. Generate features
python ml/feature_engineer.py

# 4. Check status
python ml/monitor_progress.py
```

### Option 3: Test on Small Dataset First

```bash
# Generate features for first 50 races only
python ml/feature_engineer.py --test
```

---

## 🎓 Training Your First Model

Once features are generated:

```bash
cd /Users/darcy5d/Desktop/DD_AI_models/QE2/Datafetch

# Train baseline XGBoost model
python ml/train_baseline.py

# Outputs:
# - models/xgboost_baseline.json (trained model)
# - models/feature_importance.csv (top features)
# - models/feature_columns.json (feature list)
```

**Expected metrics:**
- Winner accuracy: ~25-35% (vs ~10% random)
- Top 3 hit rate: ~50-65%
- ROI simulation at various thresholds

**Training time:** ~1-2 minutes on this dataset

## 🔍 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Temporal Integrity
- ✅ All features use only past data
- ✅ No data leakage (statistics computed before race)
- ✅ Temporal train/test split (not random)

### 2. Missing Data Handling
- ✅ Median imputation for numeric features
- ✅ Zero fill for new horses/trainers
- ✅ Graceful degradation (model works with partial data)

### 3. Class Imbalance
- ✅ Scale pos weight in XGBoost (~10:1 ratio)
- ✅ Evaluation includes both accuracy and ROI
- ✅ Threshold tuning for betting strategy

### 4. Scalability
- ✅ Pre-computed statistics (fast lookups)
- ✅ Batch processing with commits
- ✅ Indexed database queries
